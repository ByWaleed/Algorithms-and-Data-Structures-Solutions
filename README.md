# Algorithms and Data Structure Solutions

This repository contains my Java solutions to various problem solving questions from platforms such as HackerRank and LeetCode.

## Getting Started

All solutions are located in ```src``` directory and inside their respective category either in ```Algorithms``` or ```Data Structures``` directory. 

For corresponding problem to a solution, please refer to the link provided in each ```Solution.java``` file.

Also, a brief explanation of the solution is provided in the solution file and further comments are added where necessary within the code, to help understand the code.

### Prerequisites

HackerRank/LeetCode account is recommended to save progress and solutions on the platform. Otherwise, guest account is also available on HackerRank to run the code.

## Running the code

Simply copy, paste and run the code if running on HackerRank.

If running locally, then: 

* clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/ByWaleed/Hackerrank-Solutions.git```

* change directory into cloned directory and inside a problem direcotyr

* Run ```Solution.java``` with your java compiler or run the ```main``` method in ```Solution.java``` if using an IDE.

Repeat this to see each solution in action.

## Contributing

If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to raise an issues or contact me [directly](https://bywaleed.github.io).

You are also welcome to contribute with you own solution but please remmeber to make a seperate 

If contributing, please remember to write and structure you code like the getting start guide and create a sepereate file for your own solution e.g. ```Solution1.java```, ```Solution2.java```, ```Solution3.java``` inside the problem directory.
